# Educational Technology Plan
{Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan}

The purpose of the Educational Technology Plan is to ensure that all aspects of the instruction of AP Computer Science Principles at Garey High School have been explored and planned. As a result, the plan will enable the teacher to support their students to be successful.

## Context
### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles ###
{Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level}

This course is an introductory college-level computing course. Students will learn the following:
* Design and evaluate solutions.
* Apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
* Incorporate abstraction into programs.
* Use data to discover new knowledge.
* Explain how computing innovations and computing systems - including the internet - work.
* Explore the internet potential impacts and contribute to a computing culture

### Garey High School
Garey High School is one of six comprehensive high schools in the Pomona Unified School District or PUSD. It is located 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and is the third-largest school district in Los Angeles County. PUSD serves approximately 30,000 Pre-K-12 students and 17,000 adult learners at 44 schools in Pomona and Diamond Bar, California. Garey High School serves approximately 1,700 students and 

#### School Demographics by Ethnicity:
* Hispanic/Latino - 95%
* Asian - 1.8%%
* African American - 1.8%
* White - 0.6%
* Filipino - 0.3%

* American Indian - 0.1%
* Two or More Races - 0.1%

#### School Demographics by Student Group:
* Socio-Economically Disadvantaged (Title I) - 96%
* English Learners - 22.6%
* Homeless Youth - 11.8%
* Students with Disabilities - 9.6% 
* Foster Youth - 1%

### Situation

PUSD 

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

All software requires an internet connection:
* Google Apps for Education
* * Students will use the suite of Google Apps to do a variety of work, including submitting assignments, taking notes, and working collaboratively.
* Zangle (Q)
* * The Zangle (Q) database is used by the instructor to take daily attendance and keep the gradebook for the class. Students and parents may access Zangle (Q) to check their attendance and see their grade in the gradebook.


### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.
### Computer Lab (35 Student Stations + 1 Teacher Station)



### Student Devices (One-to-One)
* ASUS Chromebook C204 (1-1 Student Device)
* * Processor
* * * Intel Celeron N4000 1.1 GHz (4M Cache, up to 2.6 GHz, 2 cores)
* * Memory
* * * 4GB LPDDR4 on board, 4G LPDDR4
* * Graphics
* * * Intel UHD Graphics 600
* * Input/Output
* * * 11.6-inch, LCD, HD (1366 x 768) 16:9, Anti-glare display, LED Backlit
* * * 720p HD camera
*  * Wireless
* * * ??

### Application

{Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.}


### Impacts

{How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.}
{After listing the technical details of the plan, you will explain how you will use the technology in the Application subsection. For example, in a programming course, you will explain that students will use their IDE (which should be listed in the software) to code and run their programs but you will also describe how they will turn in the assignments and how you will grade them and give students feedback. This is also where you will describe any of the evidence-based practices you plan to adopt and how technology will support them (e.g. describing how you will apply the coherence principle to designing PowerPoint presentation slides that will be projected for lessons, and how students will share their computers to practice pair programming), as discussed in the modules on eLearning Principles and Computing Practices & Pedagogy.}
