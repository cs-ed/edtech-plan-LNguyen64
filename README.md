# Educational Technology Plan
The purpose of the Educational Technology Plan is to present an outline of the implementation of AP Computer Science Principles class at Garey High School. 
## Context
### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles ###
This course is an introductory college-level computing course. Students will learn the following:
* Design and evaluate solutions.
* Apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
* Incorporate abstraction into programs.
* Use data to discover new knowledge.
* Explain how computing innovations and computing systems - including the internet - work.
* Explore the internet potential impacts and contribute to a computing culture

Currently, this course is being offered as an elective and no prerequisites are required. The students taking this course range from Sophomores to Seniors.

### Garey High School
Garey High School is one of eight comprehensive high schools in the Pomona Unified School District (PUSD). Locating 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, PUSD is the third-largest school district in Los Angeles County. PUSD serves approximately 30,000 Pre-K-12 students and 17,000 adult learners at 44 schools in Pomona and Diamond Bar, California. Garey High School's student population is approximately 1,700 students and school's demographics are listed below:

#### School Demographics by Ethnicity:
* Hispanic/Latino - 95%
* Asian - 1.8%%
* African American - 1.8%
* White - 0.6%
* Filipino - 0.3%
* Pacific Islander - 0.1%
* American Indian - 0.1%
* Two or More Races - 0.1%

#### School Demographics by Student Group:
* Socio-Economically Disadvantaged (Title I) - 96%
* English Learners - 22.6%
* Homeless Youth - 11.8%
* Students with Disabilities - 9.6% 
* Foster Youth - 1%

### Situation
One of PUSD's four goals is to prepare students for college and career success. Therefore, every student is provided with a Chromebook. Every school site is outfitted with wireless access points in each classroom and most of the common areas. However, Wi-Fi problems are prevalent throughout the campus, such as slow or no internet access in certain buildings on campus, connections drop at random times, or student's device can't connect to the Wi-Fi. The district does provide hotspots to students, but variety problems with hotspots were reported by students during the pandemic while using Zoom. One of the courses Freshmen are required to take is one semester of Technology for the 21st Century. In this course, students are introduced to keyboarding skills, the Internet, coding in Scratch, video editing and artificial intelligence. After completing this course, students may take AP Computer Science Principles (APCSP) as an elective. However, not many students are interested in signing up for the class. One of the problems could be students do not know about the course since APCSP has been offered for the past four years. It’s usually one section and class size ranges from 15 to 20 students.

### Application
I plan to use Code.org's Computer Science Principles curriculum because it is adopted by the district. In addition, Code.org also has extensive online teacher resouces such as: 
* Daily lesson plans: detailed pacing instructions, activity guides, teaching tips and assessment.
* Teacher Dashboard: check student progress, administer assessments and integrate with Google.
The following is taken from Code.org "A Short Introduction to EIPM": 
>Code.org uses EIPM, a structured approach to teaching programming. Each letter represents a different type of lesson (E - Explore, I - Investigate, P - Practice, M - Make), which are taught in sequence for each major programming concept. It introduces concepts in a scaffolded and approachable way to encourage student collaboration, support independent creation, and clarify the role of the teacher throughout the learning process. The following paragraphs summarizes how the lesson is taught and the student's goal:

**Explore:** Students explore the new concept through a teacher-led hands-on group activity. Typically uses physical manipulatives. Teacher leads with support of slides and activity guides. The goal is students begin to develop a shared mental model and understand the main ideas of the new concept. 

**Investigate:** Students investigate two or three sample programs that use the new concept. Close-reading of working programs. Teacher-led discussions. Tasks to modify apps.
The goal is students become comfortable reading and modifying programs that use the new concept.

**Practice:** Students practice using the new concept through a scaffolded series of programming activities. Students work independently or in pairs. Teacher introduces debugging practices at the beginning of the Activity and circulates the room during the lesson to provide targeted support. The goal is students gain confidence in writing and debugging programs that use the new concept.

Pair Programming

**Make:**  Students make a target app for which they are given the screen elements but little to no starter code. Students are provided high-level steps to break down the project. Teacher supports students by directing them towards notes, previous work, and debugging strategies practiced in earlier lessons. The goal is students are able to independently decide when and how to use the new concept in the context of a larger project.

**Assessment:** The course materials contain a number of assessment types and opportunities which can be used formatively (to check for understanding) or summatively (for evaluation). For students, the goal of the assessments is to prepare them for the AP exam and performance task. For teachers, the goal is to use assessments to help guide instruction, give feedback to students, and make choices about what to emphasize in lessons.Code Studio includes features that assist the teacher in completing formative and summative assessments: Multiple choice or matching questions related to questions on the chapter summative assessment. Free-response text fields where students may input their answers. Access to student work within the App Lab programming environment and other digital tools and widgets used in the curriculum.

### Impacts
Nowadays, the technology and human life cannot be separated. We rely so much on technology that it becomes an integral part of our lives. Computer science (CS) is an important element in strengthening existing education models and preparing students for the future. However, there is a lack of interest in CS education. One reason may be that learning CS comes with a fair amount of social stigma for students. This stigma could be attributed to the commonly held belief that CS is a male-oriented field that involves social isolation and a focus on machinery rather than people (Cheryan et al. 2015).

It is important to dispel some of these misconceptions of what computer science is and who it is for. Media stereotypes of people who work in computing fields don’t always address the reality of the work or the people involved, and connecting students to real computer programmers, app developers and others working in the field can help students see themselves also working in those types of job. To increase interest in computing among girls, for example, invite women working in computer science careers to come to school and give a presentation about their job. Schedule field trips to nearby tech companies locating in southern Califrona, such as Google will do a lot to help students see that CS is within reach. 
Additionally, having students doing collaborative activities, such as pair programming, where students can work and learn from each other. Seeing that their peers's excitement and joy in what they are creating would help them see CS is not such an intimidating or complicated subject.

Computer science is an interdisplinary. Eventhough students don't want to major in computer science in college, they can take the skills - collaboration and problem solving - and apply to a wide variety of different fields, such as liberal arts, health sciences, and visual arts.
