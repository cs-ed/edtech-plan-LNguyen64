# Educational Technology Plan
The purpose of the Educational Technology Plan is to present an outline of the implementation of AP Computer Science Principles class at Garey High School. 
## Context
### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles ###
This course is an introductory college-level computing course. Students will learn the following:
* Design and evaluate solutions.
* Apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
* Incorporate abstraction into programs.
* Use data to discover new knowledge.
* Explain how computing innovations and computing systems - including the internet - work.
* Explore the internet potential impacts and contribute to a computing culture

Currently, this course is being offered as an elective and no prerequisites are required. The students taking this course range from Sophomores to Seniors.

### Garey High School
Garey High School is one of eight comprehensive high schools in the Pomona Unified School District (PUSD). Locating 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, PUSD is the third-largest school district in Los Angeles County. PUSD serves approximately 30,000 Pre-K-12 students and 17,000 adult learners at 44 schools in Pomona and Diamond Bar, California. Garey High School's student population is approximately 1,700 students and school's demographics are listed below:

#### School Demographics by Ethnicity:
* Hispanic/Latino - 95%
* Asian - 1.8%%
* African American - 1.8%
* White - 0.6%
* Filipino - 0.3%
* Pacific Islander - 0.1%
* American Indian - 0.1%
* Two or More Races - 0.1%

#### School Demographics by Student Group:
* Socio-Economically Disadvantaged (Title I) - 96%
* English Learners - 22.6%
* Homeless Youth - 11.8%
* Students with Disabilities - 9.6% 
* Foster Youth - 1%

### Situation
One of PUSD's four goals is to prepare students for college and career success. Therefore, every student is provided with a Chromebook. Every school site is outfitted with wireless access points in each classroom and most of the common areas. However, Wi-Fi problems are prevalent throughout the campus, such as slow or no internet access in certain buildings on campus, connections drop at random times, or student's device can't connect to the Wi-Fi. The district does provide hotspots to students, but variety problems with hotspots were reported by students during the pandemic while using Zoom.

### Application
I plan to use Code.org's Computer Science Principles curriculum because it is adopted by the district. In addition, Code.org also has extensive online teacher resouces such as: 
* Daily lesson plans: detailed pacing instructions, activity guides, teaching tips and assessment.
* Teacher Dashboard: check student progress, administer assessments and integrate with Google.
The following is taken from Code.org "A Short Introduction to EIPM": 
>Code.org uses EIPM, a structured approach to teaching programming. Each letter represents a different type of lesson (E - Explore, I - Investigate, P - Practice, M - Make), which are taught in sequence for each major programming concept. It introduces concepts in a scaffolded and approachable way to encourage student collaboration, support independent creation, and clarify the role of the teacher throughout the learning process. The following paragraphs summarizes how the lesson is taught and the student's goal:

**Explore:** Students explore the new concept through a teacher-led hands-on group activity. Typically uses physical manipulatives. Teacher leads with support of slides and activity guides. The goal is students begin to develop a shared mental model and understand the main ideas of the new concept. 

**Investigate:** Students investigate two or three sample programs that use the new concept. Close-reading of working programs. Teacher-led discussions. Tasks to modify apps.
The goal is students become comfortable reading and modifying programs that use the new concept.

**Practice:** Students practice using the new concept through a scaffolded series of programming activities. Students work independently or in pairs. Teacher introduces debugging practices at the beginning of the Activity and circulates the room during the lesson to provide targeted support. The goal is students gain confidence in writing and debugging programs that use the new concept.

**Make:**  Students make a target app for which they are given the screen elements but little to no starter code. Students are provided high-level steps to break down the project. Teacher supports students by directing them towards notes, previous work, and debugging strategies practiced in earlier lessons. The goal is students are able to independently decide when and how to use the new concept in the context of a larger project.

**Assessment:** The course materials contain a number of assessment types and opportunities which can be used formatively (to check for understanding) or summatively (for evaluation). For students, the goal of the assessments is to prepare them for the AP exam and performance task. For teachers, the goal is to use assessments to help guide instruction, give feedback to students, and make choices about what to emphasize in lessons.Code Studio includes features that assist the teacher in completing formative and summative assessments: Multiple choice or matching questions related to questions on the chapter summative assessment. Free-response text fields where students may input their answers.Access to student work within the App Lab programming environment and other digital tools and widgets used in the curriculum.

### Daily Warm-Up via Google Form or Pear Deck
The warm-up is to review the previous's day lesson or to spiral review from prior concepts. In addition, I plan to have the students Think-Write-Pair-Share. This strategy is designed to differentiate instruction by providing students with time and structure for thinking about a given topic, enabling them to formulate individual ideas and share these ideas with a peer.


### Impacts

{How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.}
{After listing the technical details of the plan, you will explain how you will use the technology in the Application subsection. For example, in a programming course, you will explain that students will use their IDE (which should be listed in the software) to code and run their programs but you will also describe how they will turn in the assignments and how you will grade them and give students feedback. This is also where you will describe any of the evidence-based practices you plan to adopt and how technology will support them (e.g. describing how you will apply the coherence principle to designing PowerPoint presentation slides that will be projected for lessons, and how students will share their computers to practice pair programming), as discussed in the modules on eLearning Principles and Computing Practices & Pedagogy.}
