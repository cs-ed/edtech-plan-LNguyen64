# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of the Educational Technology Plan is to present an outline of the implementation of AP Computer Science Principles class at Garey High School. 

## Context
### Course
#### AP Computer Science Principles ###

This course is an introductory college-level computing course. Students will learn the following:
* Design and evaluate solutions.
* Apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.
* Incorporate abstraction into programs.
* Use data to discover new knowledge.
* Explain how computing innovations and computing systems - including the internet - work.
* Explore the internet potential impacts and contribute to a computing culture

This course is offered as a third year math course for students to take after completing Integrated Math 1 and Integrated Math II during their Freshman and Sophomore years. This course will be offered to Juniors and Seniors and prepare them to take the AP Computer Science Principles exam.

### Garey High School
Garey High School is one of eight comprehensive high schools in the Pomona Unified School District (PUSD). Locating 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, PUSD is the third-largest school district in Los Angeles County. PUSD serves approximately 30,000 Pre-K-12 students and 17,000 adult learners at 44 schools in Pomona and Diamond Bar, California. Garey High School serves approximately 1,700 students and school's demographics are listed below:

#### School Demographics by Ethnicity:
* Hispanic/Latino - 95%
* Asian - 1.8%%
* African American - 1.8%
* White - 0.6%
* Filipino - 0.3%
* Pacific Islander - 0.1%
* American Indian - 0.1%
* Two or More Races - 0.1%

#### School Demographics by Student Group:
* Socio-Economically Disadvantaged (Title I) - 96%
* English Learners - 22.6%
* Homeless Youth - 11.8%
* Students with Disabilities - 9.6% 
* Foster Youth - 1%

### Situation

One of PUSD's four goals is to prepare students for college and career success. Therefore, every student is provided with a Chromebook. Every school site is outfilled with wireless access points in each classroom and most of the common areas. However, wi-fi is spotty and

### Application

{Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.}
Garey High School chooses CODE.org. Per the College Board website:
> Code.org's AP CSP curriculum resources use engaging, discovery-based approach to address big topics like >how the internet works, big data, and programming apps in JavaScript. The curriculum consists of daily >lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that cover the AP CSP learning objectives. 

Assessments:
Students will be assessed 

### Impacts

{How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.}
{After listing the technical details of the plan, you will explain how you will use the technology in the Application subsection. For example, in a programming course, you will explain that students will use their IDE (which should be listed in the software) to code and run their programs but you will also describe how they will turn in the assignments and how you will grade them and give students feedback. This is also where you will describe any of the evidence-based practices you plan to adopt and how technology will support them (e.g. describing how you will apply the coherence principle to designing PowerPoint presentation slides that will be projected for lessons, and how students will share their computers to practice pair programming), as discussed in the modules on eLearning Principles and Computing Practices & Pedagogy.}
